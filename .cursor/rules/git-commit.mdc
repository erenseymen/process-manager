# Context Files

Always reference these files when relevant to the task:
- `README.md` - Project documentation, features, and setup instructions
- `docs/ai-context.md` - Important architectural context and patterns for the codebase

# Git Commit Rule

At the end of each response, if changes were made to files, commit these changes with git.

## Rules

1. After making code or file changes, run `git add` and `git commit` commands at the end of the response
2. Use conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:, etc.)
3. Only commit when actual changes were made, do not commit when only reading or analysis was performed
4. Update `README.md` if needed

# AI Context Rule

Save important context about the codebase for future AI sessions in `docs/ai-context.md`. Always read `docs/ai-context.md` at the start of sessions to understand existing patterns and architecture.

## Rules

1. When significant architectural decisions, patterns, or conventions are established, append them to `docs/ai-context.md`
2. If `docs/ai-context.md` does not exist, create it with a header
3. Save context about:
   - Project architecture and design patterns
   - Key dependencies and their purposes
   - Important conventions or coding standards used
   - Complex logic that requires explanation
   - Known issues or limitations
4. Keep entries concise and actionable
5. Use markdown headers to organize sections (e.g., `## Architecture`, `## Dependencies`)
6. Include timestamps when adding new context entries
7. Commit context file changes along with related code changes
