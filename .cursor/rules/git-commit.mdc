# Git Commit Rule

At the end of each response, if changes were made to files, commit these changes with git.

## Rules

1. After making code or file changes, run `git add` and `git commit` commands at the end of the response
2. Use conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:, etc.)
3. Only commit when actual changes were made, do not commit when only reading or analysis was performed
4. If source files in `src/` are added, removed, or renamed, update the Project Structure section in `README.md` accordingly
