# Git Commit Rule

At the end of each response, if changes were made to files, commit these changes with git.

## Rules

1. After making code or file changes, run `git add` and `git commit` commands at the end of the response
2. Use conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, chore:, etc.)
3. Only commit when actual changes were made, do not commit when only reading or analysis was performed
4. Update `README.md` accordingly

# AI Context Rule

Save important context about the codebase for future AI sessions.

## Rules

1. When significant architectural decisions, patterns, or conventions are established, save them using the memory tool
2. Save context about:
   - Project architecture and design patterns
   - Key dependencies and their purposes
   - Important conventions or coding standards used
   - Complex logic that requires explanation
   - Known issues or limitations
3. Keep memories concise and actionable
